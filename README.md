This micro app was hacked during some @eurucamp 2013 talks.
After giving a workshop, I wish people could just connect on my local machine and leave a note in an unintrusive way.

## Tests

This app has no.<br>
But trust me, it works.

## Setup

Clone the app, `bundle install` and `rake db:create` to create the database.
You can start the server with `ruby app.rb -o 0.0.0.0`.

## Leaving feedback

If you're on the Mac, just tell people to visit `#{your_computer_name}.local`.
For instance, if computer name is Batman and we're on the same wifi, you can see it as `batman.local`.
